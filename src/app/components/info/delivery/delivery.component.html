    delivery, while express shipping usually takes 1-2 business days. Shipping
    costs will be calculated based on the weight and destination of your order
    at checkout.We strive to process and ship all orders within 24 hours of
    receiving them, with the exception of weekends and holidays. Once your order
    has been shipped, you will receive a tracking number via email so you can
    track your package's progress.Please note that we cannot guarantee delivery
    times due to unforeseen circumstances such as weather, customs delays, or
    carrier issues. However, we will do everything in our power to ensure that
    your package arrives as quickly as possible.
