        >What do I do when there is an alligator in my neighborhood?</span
      >
      <div class="c-faq__answer">
        In many cases, if left unmolested, alligators eventually will retreat to
        more preferred habitats away from people. However, if you encounter an
        animal that poses a threat to human safety:
        <br />
        DON'T - swim outside of posted swimming areas or in waters that might
        contain large alligators.
        <br />
        DO - swim with a partner within all marked swimming areas. These areas
        are specifically situated and designed to reduce potential
        alligator/human conflicts.
        <br />
        DON'T - swim at night or dusk when alligators most actively feed.

      <div class="c-faq__answer">
        Both Prince William and Prince Harry receive a salary from the British
        Army. Any additional costs are met by The Prince of Wales or from their

        >Can I use someone else’s urine in my Whizzinator Kit?</span
      >
      <div class="c-faq__answer">
        Yes, you can use someone else’s urine in our kit. We just ask that you
        be 110% sure the urine is clean before you use their urine. If you do
        use someone else’s urine simply collect the sample the day of your test
        and inject it into The Whizzinator with the refill syringe. Use the
        sample that day.

      <span class="c-faq__title">Do I have to be fat to do sumo?</span>
      <div class="c-faq__answer">
        No, you do not have to be fat. In fact, most of the very successful sumo
        wrestlers, both professional and amateur, are not fat, by any standard.
        Generally, if you are athletic, you can do well in sumo. Of course, fat
        or skinny, big or small, you are welcome to participate in sumo.

      <span class="c-faq__title">Can pregnant woman bellydance too?</span>
      <div class="c-faq__answer">
        Of course, pregnant women find belly dancing excellent prenatal exercise
        because it strengthens the pelvic muscles and loosens up the abdominal
        area. It strengthens back and leg muscles, which are very critical for a
        woman to carry her pregnancy well.
